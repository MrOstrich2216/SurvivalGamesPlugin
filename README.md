# üèπ Survival Games Plugin

Hi, this is MrOstrich ‚Äî glad you're here! This is a Minecraft plugin I built for a school gaming competition, with help from Copilot (AI really came through). It‚Äôs designed for LAN servers and inspired by the UHC RUN plugin, but with natural regeneration and no golden heads ‚Äî keeping it easy and fun for players.

## üéÆ Features

- **Match Lifecycle**: `WAITING ‚Üí GRACE ‚Üí FIGHT ‚Üí FINAL_FIGHT ‚Üí ENDED`
- **Grace Period**: PvP disabled, players scattered randomly, one life only
- **Final Fight Trigger**: Based on scoreboard alive count (not raw player list)
- **Exempt User Support**: Admins like `"Recorder"` are excluded from stats and match logic
- **Custom Death Messages**: Weapon-based, ranged kills with distance, bare hands fallback
- **Sound Effects**:
  - Start: `UI_TOAST_CHALLENGE_COMPLETE`
  - Grace End: `BLOCK_BEACON_ACTIVATE`
  - Final Fight: `ENTITY_WITHER_SPAWN`
  - Death: `ENTITY_LIGHTNING_BOLT_THUNDER`
  - Victory: `ENTITY_FIREWORK_ROCKET_LAUNCH` + `ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP` (looped 5x)
- **Scoreboard & UI**:
  - Dynamic team tracking
  - Glowing red outline during final fight
  - Title + ActionBar messages
- **Border Control**: Configurable via `BorderUtil`, shrink logic per phase
- **Inventory Wipe**: On game end, armor and potion effects cleared
