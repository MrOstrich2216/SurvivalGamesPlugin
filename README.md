# üèπ Survival Games Plugin
Hi, this is MrOstrich. Im happy that you are here. This is a Minecraft Plugin i've build for a Gaming Competition in my School using Copilot (though ai this is good). This is mainly built in thought of LAN servers.
So it is kinda based upon UHC RUN plugin. It's just this has natural regeneration so no golden heads. Keeping it easy for players.
